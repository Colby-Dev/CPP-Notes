----- C++ Structures (struct) -----

C++ structures are user-defined types to group related variables of different types togehter under a single
name. Structures are also known as structs. 

Structures are used to represent a record. 

--- Defining a Structure ---

To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. 

struct [tag]{
};

The tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition. At the end of the struct
definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one ore more structure variables but this is optional

--- Accessing Structure Members --- 

To access any members of a stucture, we use the member access operator(.). The member access operator is 
coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You
would use struct keyword to define variables of structure type.
