/* 
------ Operators ------
An operator is a symbol that tells the complier to perform specific math or
logical manipulations. C++ provides the following: 

> Arithmetic Operators 
> Relational Operators
> Logical Operators 
> Bitwise Operators 
> Assignment Operators
> Misc Operators

----- Arthimetic Operators -----
Basic operators used for basic math and arithmatic. 
+ , - , * , / , % , ++ , --

----- Relational Operators -----
Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. 
These operators return a boolean value TRUE and FALSE 
== , != , > , < , >= , <=

----- Logical Operators -----
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (true or false).
These operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are 3 primary logical operators in C++ 
&& , || , !

----- Bitwise Operators -----
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations at the bit level on integer data types. 
These operations work on direct manipulation of bits, such as low-level programming, graphics, and cryptography
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101

----- Assignment Operators -----
Assignment operaotrs are usd to assign values to variables. 
These operators allow you to set or update the value stored in a variable.

----- Misc Operators -----
Miscellaneous operators, often avvreviated as "misc operators",
include a variety of operators that dont fit neatly into other 
categories like arithmetic or logical operators. 
sizeof, Condition ? X : Y , . -> , Cast, & , *

----- Operators Precedence ------
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. 
This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher
precedence than others; 
Example: 

x = 7 + 3 * 2
x is assigned 13, since * has a higher precendence than +
