----- Class Access Modifiers -----

C++ access modifiers are used for data hiding implementation. Data hiding is one of the
important features of OOP, which allows functions of a program to access directly the
internal representation of a class type. The access restriction to the class members is
specified by the labeled public, private, and protected sections within the class body.

The keywords private, public, and protected are called access specifiers.
